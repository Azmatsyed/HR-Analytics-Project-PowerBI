# HR Analytics Dashboard – Employee Attrition Analysis (Power BI)

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns to help HR teams identify key factors contributing to turnover. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes attrition based on demographics, departments, salary, tenure, and job satisfaction.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore the HR dataset and answer business questions such as:

- Which departments have the highest attrition rates?
- How does job satisfaction relate to attrition?
- Are certain age groups or tenures more likely to leave?
- What is the average salary and tenure of employees who leave vs. stay?

The dashboard helps decision-makers spot trends and take proactive measures to improve employee retention.
